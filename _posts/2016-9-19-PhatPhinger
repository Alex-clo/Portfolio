# Challenge: End users who have large fingers to interact with the web are a challenge for developers, UX/UI folks, and web designers. #


### Solution: PhatPhinger turns a developer's cursor into a lifesize, yet oversized finger to help better develop components (text links, clickable photos, etc) and increase accessibility. ###


#### Outcome: With a few lines of jQuery, the cursor is now a 'fat' fingerprint. I'm currently accepting pull requests to improve this project (heat mapped fingers, handprints, palms, etc.)  ####
