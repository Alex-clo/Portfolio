<h1>Challenge: While most aspiring and junior developers learn Git commands, it is usually difficult to practice those skills in a social environment.</h1><img src='assets/images/gitty.png'> <br /><em>Practicing Git alone is common amongst aspiring developers, but rarely the reality of a technical work environment.</em>

        
 <h3>Solution: Git-Er-Dun: The Collaborative Git Simulator replicates a 'live' working and coding environment. Devs use the simulator in conjunction with two other popular social work tools, Github and Slack, to increase efficiency and collaboration.</h3>

<em>With Git-Er-Dun, devs use a step-based script to complete Git tasks. By the end of the script, the devs have utilized Git commands of their choosing to collaboratively complete the project.</em>
 <h4>Outcome: With my Git-Er-Dun collaborative simulation, devs can now work out actual Git commands together in a relaxed environment, while boosting their confidence when it comes to deploying these skills on the job. Currently available as a two-person beta release, the project will soon expand to include a stable release, in addition to a three-person beta release.</h4>
