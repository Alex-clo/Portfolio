# Challenge: While most aspiring and junior developers learn Git commands, it is usually difficult to practice those skills in a social environment. #

_Practicing Git alone is common amongst aspiring developers, but rarely the reality of a technical work environment._

### Solution: Git-Er-Dun: The Collaborative Git Simulator replicates a 'live' working and coding environment. Devs use the simulator in conjunction with two other popular social work tools, Github and Slack, to increase efficiency and collaboration. ###

_With Git-Er-Dun, devs use a step-based script to complete Git tasks. By the end of the script, the devs have utilized Git commands of their choosing to collaboratively complete the project._
#### Outcome: With my Git-Er-Dun collaborative simulation, devs can now work out actual Git commands together in a relaxed environment, while boosting their confidence when it comes to deploying these skills on the job. Currently available as a two-person beta release, the project will soon expand to include a stable release, in addition to a three-person beta release. ####
