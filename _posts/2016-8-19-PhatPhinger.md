# Challenge: End users who have large fingers to interact with the web are a challenge for developers, UX/UI folks, and web designers. #


### Solution: PhatPhinger turns a developer's cursor into a lifesize, yet oversized finger to help better develop components. Test your links, images, and other touchables. . .Do they accommodate fat fingers, or are they too close to each other? Use this simple app to find out. ###


#### Outcome: With a few lines of jQuery, the cursor is now a 'fat' fingerprint. I'm currently accepting pull requests to improve this project (heat mapped fingers, handprints, palms, etc.)  ####
