# Challenge: Mobile app users who have large fingers are a challenge for developers, UX/UI specialists, and web designers. Elements that are spaced appropriately for 'normal' users are too close together and often unusable for this audience.  #


### Solution: PhatPhinger turns a tester's cursor into a lifesize oversized finger to help develop app elements more inclusively. Team members can test links, images, and other touchables. . .Do they accommodate larger fingers, or are the elements too close to each other? This simple app answers that question with a quick, real-time visual answer. ###


#### Outcome: With a few lines of jQuery, the cursor is now a larger-than-average fingerprint. PhatPhinger could be potential tool employed during the application testing phase, resulting in increased testing efficiency while remaining accessibility-minded. Currently accepting pull requests to enhance feature set (heat mapped fingers, handprints, palms, etc.).  ####
