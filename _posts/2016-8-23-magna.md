# Challenge: Bethie needed a responsive ecommerce app that she could manage on her own. #

     
## Solution: With its fresh color palette, intuitive control panel, and full encryption on both the front and back ends, BethiesBackyard.com gave her the confidence to run her own online store, while providing a friendly hub for her customer base that encourages user interaction through a custom review system. ##

_The backend of Bethie's was finely tuned using PHP with the help of the fast, flexible, and secure Twig templating language._

#### Outcome: BethiesBackyard.com is a full-fledged organic and all-natural online ecommerce venue, with full SSL encryption for added security and customer confidence. I also amplified the colorful personality of Bethie with the help of CSS via Sass. Brilliantly responsive with Bootstrap. Multiple MySQL databases, mainly adminstered by me in phpMyAdmin, hold both site and customer information.####
