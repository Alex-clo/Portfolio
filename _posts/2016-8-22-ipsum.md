_The popup newsletter Dev Mojo reached cult status during its short but impactful run._
# Challenge: The RealToughCandy (RTC) YouTube channel reached critical mass, and needed an "overflow" site where subscribers could catch up with their community. #
![RealToughCandy]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/rtc.png)_Code-centric blog posts find a home for RTC members and global devs alike. The clickbait JavaScript article (lower left) was meant to be sarcastic clickbait, but ended up being clickbait clickbait. My bad._

        
### Solution: On the dev side, I chose pane-based blog posts with image covers to provide a lookbook of entires, while a fixed navbar provides easy navigation. PHP & MySQL are on backend duty for commenting on posts and contacting me. ###

![RealToughCandy]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/rtc2.png)_Links to important community documents are prominently displayed on the navbar, without intruding on users._

#### Outcome: RealToughCandy.com has helped developers learn everything from essential Atom packages, to the best books and video courses on learning basic web development. Under the hood, while the Wordpress CMS abstracts my workflow more than I would like, the interface is unbeatable for non-technical clients. Additionally, constructing my own Wordpress templates and toying with plugins has been a foray into employing PHP & MySQL, and untangling lots of jQuery. ####
