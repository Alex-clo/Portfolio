_The popup newsletter Dev Mojo reached cult status during its short but impactful run._
# Challenge: The RealToughCandy (RTC) YouTube channel reached critical mass, and needed an "overflow" site where subscribers could catch up with their community. #
![RealToughCandy]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/rtc.png)_Code-centric blog posts find a home for RTC members and global devs alike. The clickbait JavaScript article (lower left) was meant to be sarcastic clickbait, but ended up being clickbait clickbait. My bad._

        
### Solution: Realtoughcandy.com's content incorporates stylistic flourishes that define the RealToughCandy lifestyle - technically experimental, bold, and obsessed with tech. On the dev side, I chose pane-based blog posts with image covers to provide a lookbook of entires, while a fixed navbar provides continous ease of navigation. The standard PHP & MySQL plays backend here, for commenting on posts and contacting me. ###

![RealToughCandy]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/rtc2.png)_Links to critical community documents, such as my Code of Conduct, are prominently displayed on the navbar, without intruding on users._

#### Outcome: With over 1100 unique vistors since its inception as a web developer blog in March, 2017, RealToughCandy.com has helped developers learn everything from essential Atom packages, to the best books and video courses on learning basic web development. Under the hood, while the Wordpress CMS abstracts my workflow more than I would like, the interface is unbeatable for non-technical clients. Additionally, constructing my own Wordpress templates and toying with plugins has been a foray into employing PHP & MySQL, and untangling lots of jQuery. ####
