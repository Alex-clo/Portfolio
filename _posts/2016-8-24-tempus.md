# Challenge: A client does multimedia work and needed a site that stood out from the crowd. #

        
### Solution: A cross between Jeopardy and a hip digital agency, users flip tiles to discover more about the brand. This interaction plays perfectly with my React-based solution. ###
### Each tile is two “slides” worth of information: The first slide is a challenge and solution, and the second slide is a result. ###
![Barncat Slide]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/barncat.png)_Example of second slide in photo section.  Branding on each tile emphasizes message impact._

#### Outcome: A fresh take on the digital agency, this site adds an engaging experience for users with full responsiveness. Under the hood, React facilitates speedy pages and a clean, componetized coding experience. Todos include adding an embedded contact form and various mouse/hover events. ####
