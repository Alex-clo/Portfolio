# Challenge: I do multimedia work and needed a site that stood out from the crowd. I also wanted to flex my React skills. #

        
### Solution: A cross between Jeopardy and a hip agency with just a tinge of a throwback feel, the site architecture compels the user to complete flipping the tiles, consequently increasing site visit time while building trust through narrative and engagement. ###
### Each tile is two “slides” worth of information: The first slide is a challenge and solution, and the second slide is a result (i.e. the implementation as created by BarncatDigital). ###
![Barncat Slide]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/Portfolio/assets/images/barncat.png)_Example of second slide in photo section. Succinct wording and Barncat branding on each tile increases message impact._

#### Outcome: A fresh take on the often overwrought digital agency site adds credibility and a fun, engaging experience for users, with full responsiveness. Under the hood, React facilitates speedy pages and a clean, componetized coding experience. Todos include adding an embedded contact form and various mouse/hover events. ####
