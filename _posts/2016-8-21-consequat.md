## No problem statement here; no solution or outcome paragraph. [`Youtube.com/realtoughcandy`](https://youtube.com/realtoughcandy) is the channel that started it all: my supercharged passion for web development, deep educational tributary networks, and the gathering of fellow developers who resonate with the idea that web development should be experimental, bold, and accessible. ##

### RealToughCandy is a true tech alternative, embracing the old-school while pushing forward to the new-school, while natively developing the rest. ###

Numerous tributary networks have sprouted from this channel, including a Gitter chatroom, blog and dev newsletter (as highlighted in this portfolio), mentorships, and countless 'offline' communications that have created massive value for the dev community.
