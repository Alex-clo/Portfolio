[`Youtube.com/realtoughcandy`](https://youtube.com/realtoughcandy) is the channel that started it all: my supercharged passion for web development, tech social networks, and the gathering of fellow developers who resonate with the idea that web development should be experimental, bold, and accessible. 

### RealToughCandy is a tech alternative, highlighting how the Internet works and why it matters. ###

Tributary networks continute to sprout from this channel, including a Gitter chatroom for tech talk, blog, newsletter, mentorships, and countless 'offline' communications that have created massive value for the dev community.
