# Challenge: 'We have a tech talent shortage' is a common cry among the media, the government, the private sector, and often,  the tech sector itself. I wanted to create a site highlighting up-and-coming devs who are living, working proof that this is a false narrative. #

_The Dev Spotlight Series highlights the next generation of talented, dedicated tech developers._

### Solution: The Dev Spotlight is an interactive space that pays homage to the nascent 'net, with some modern cosmetic and functional updates. Featuring a jQuery-based terminal simulator as a navigation bar for "superusers", the site also remains accessible to non-techies with a simple, clearly defined clickable photo gallery along with a clickable About tab. ###

Skeleton CSS on each dev profile ensures 100% responsive design. I also incorporated colors to reduce eye strain, such as _aliceblue_ instead of white, and a medium gray to replace black text. Finally, I optimized the landing page for mobile users by removing the terminal.

_Oversized names as each profile's header section create a sharp, exclusive magazine feel._

#### Outcome: The Dev Spotlight Series is an avant garde take on design without being glib, with progressive enhancement for maximum UX/UI. These developers now have a home that is hip, interactive, and 100% responsive.  ####
